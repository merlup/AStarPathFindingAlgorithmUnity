A tool to help converting your scripts from Javascript to C#.

This is a must have if you're converting an entire project to Javascript. This editor tool helps you to convert all your C# scripts to Javascript/Unityscript. This tool covers the most labor intensive work for you. Note: Very basic C# scripts will convert right away, but most scripts will need some minor manual adjustments after conversion, therefore basic C# syntax knowledge is required to be able to fix the last few bits that the convertor can't fix automatically for you.
Also check out the "JS to C# converter" on the Asset store for conversion the other way around.

Thank you for buying this package from the Unity store.
To make this script easily worth your bucks start converting some scripts, add the package to your project. It's all about the "Editor/CtoJs.c" file:
1. Select one or more C# files and select the new editor window option: "Tools/Convert selected C# file(s) to JS".
2. For every of the C# files you selected a JS copy will be made. Your C# files will not be deleted, but you should do so yourself after confirming the conversion.
3. Verify the conversion.


While the converter does the majority of the work, there are usually a few errors that you'll need to fix manually.
Unity will trow compile errors for the last bits. Do also verify the script still works at runtime(!).

Disclaimer: I can not be held responsible for the outcome of the conversion, do validate the output.
